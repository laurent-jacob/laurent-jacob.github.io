title: CALDERA
summary: A follow-up on DBGWAS. We use the structure of the de Bruijn graph to define new genomic variants (e.g. gene presence) that accomodate polymorphisms. This amounts to defining one variant for each connected subgraph. We rely on a reverse search strategy to efficiently enumerate variants, and on the Tarone strategy to control the FWER when testing their association with a bacterial phenotype.
