summary: Convolutional neural networks on biological sequences are known to learn probabilistic motifs associated with the target phenotype. To go beyond this informal interpretation, we provide a statistical test quantifying the motif-phenotype association. This requires to solve a post-selection inference problem, where the selection involves the infinite set of possible motifs.
