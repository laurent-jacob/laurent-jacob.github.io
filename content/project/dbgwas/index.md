title: DBGWAS
summary: Wï»¿e describe the variation in bacterial genomes through their content in short sequences (k-mers). This avoids the bias usually caused by focusing on pre-defined SNPs or gene lists. We use this representation to pinpoint the genomic variation associated to antimicrobial resitances, and rely on a so-called de Bruijn graph to help make sense of the identified k-mers in terms of SNPs or mobile genetic elements.
