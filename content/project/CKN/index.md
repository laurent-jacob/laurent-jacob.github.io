summary: Wï»¿e analyze convolutional and recurrent neural networks for biological sequences in the framework of positive definite kernels. In addition to providing a new interpretation on the genomic features underlying these networks, this analysis provides a version that is better regularized and performs better when few data is available. We also extended this work to graph-structured data.
