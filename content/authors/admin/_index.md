I am a senior [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) researcher located at
the [LCQB](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/) lab of [Sorbonne
Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in Paris.

I work on machine learning and statistics to answer questions in
genomics. I am particularly interested in microbial genomics, notably
to better understand and predict drug resistances, and in evolutionary
genomics. Part of my work also aim at better understanding neural
networks for biological sequences. See the [Projects](/#projects)
section for some examples.

I received an MSc in machine learning from ENS Cachan (now ENS
Paris-Saclay) in 2006, and a Ph.D. from Mines ParisTech in 2009, where
I worked on regularized machine learning for computational
biology. Between 2010 and 2012 I was a postdoctoral fellow at the
statistics department of UC Berkeley. I joined the CNRS in 2013 and
worked at the [LBBE](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/en) lab in [Université
Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/en) until 2023.

You can reach me at firstname (dot) lastname (at) cnrs (dot) fr.
